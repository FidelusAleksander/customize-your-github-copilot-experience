# Games in Python Assignment

## Assignment Overview

In this assignment, you will build a simple version of the classic game "Hangman" using Python. This project will help you practice working with strings, loops, conditionals, and user input.

## Instructions

1. Write a Python program that implements the Hangman game.
2. The program should randomly select a word for the player to guess.
3. The player should guess one letter at a time.
4. The program should display the current state of the word (with unguessed letters as underscores) after each guess.
5. The player has a limited number of incorrect guesses before the game ends.
6. Display a win or lose message at the end of the game.

## Requirements

Your completed program should:

- Randomly select a word from a list of possible words.
- Allow the player to guess one letter at a time.
- Show the current progress of the word after each guess.
- Track and display the number of incorrect guesses remaining.
- End the game when the player either guesses the word or runs out of guesses.
- Display an appropriate message for winning or losing.

## Submission

Save your code in a file named `hangman.py` and submit it as instructed by your teacher or course platform.
