## Step 1: Setting Up Copilot Instructions

You, Mr Johnson want to establish general high level standards for AI assistants to follow whenever working on your homework assignment project for the class of Mergington High School.

### üìñ Theory: Repository Custom Instructions

Repository custom instructions allow you to provide Copilot with context about your project standards. By creating a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file, you can ensure that Copilot's suggestions consistently follow your teaching conventions and help generate assignments that meet your pedagogical goals.

These instructions are automatically included in Copilot's context when working on files in your repository, helping maintain consistency across your entire project.
