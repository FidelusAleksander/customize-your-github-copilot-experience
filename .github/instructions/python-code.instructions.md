# Python Code Instructions

When writing Python code for educational assignments:

## Code Style
- Use clear, descriptive variable names that help students understand the purpose
- Follow PEP 8 conventions for formatting and style
- Include docstrings for all functions and classes
- Add inline comments to explain complex logic or important concepts

## Educational Focus
- Write code that demonstrates best practices students should learn
- Include examples that progress from simple to more complex
- Use meaningful print statements to show program output
- Avoid overly advanced language features unless they're the learning objective

## Error Handling
- Include basic error handling where appropriate for student learning
- Use clear error messages that help students understand what went wrong
- Demonstrate defensive programming practices

## Examples and Templates
- Provide starter code that gives students a foundation to build upon
- Include TODO comments to guide students on what they need to implement
- Show complete, working examples alongside exercises
