# Project Description

This project provides a simple way to organize student homework assignments in folders and make them available as a website. Students can browse, view, and download assignments directly from the portal.

##  Assignments

All assignments are structured in a consistent way to ensure clarity and no confusion. All assignments are stored in the [`assignments/`](../assignments/) folder, each in its own subfolder.

## Website

The website serves as a static portal for browsing and viewing assignments. 

The [`config.json`](../website/config.json) file contains metadata for each assignment, which is used to generate the assignment list and details dynamically. 

The website does not require a build step; changes are reflected immediately.
