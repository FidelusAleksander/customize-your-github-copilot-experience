# Project Description

This project provides a simple way to organize student homework assignments in folders and make them available as a website. Students can browse, view, and download assignments directly from the portal.

## Project Structure

- **Assignments**: All assignments are stored in the [`assignments/`](../assignments/) folder, each in its own subfolder with a consistent structure to ensure clarity and no confusion.
- **Templates**: Reusable templates are stored in the [`templates/`](../templates/) folder for consistent assignment creation.
- **Website**: The website serves as a static portal for browsing and viewing assignments. The [`config.json`](../website/config.json) file contains metadata for each assignment, which is used to generate the assignment list and details dynamically. The website does not require a build step; changes are reflected immediately.


## Educational Standards

When generating content for this project:

- **Learning-focused**: All content should be designed with clear learning objectives and appropriate difficulty levels
- **Consistent structure**: Follow established patterns for assignments, templates, and documentation
- **Student-friendly**: Use clear, encouraging language that motivates students
- **Progressive difficulty**: Build complexity gradually across assignments
